# Constraint-Based-Lyrical-Generation-Benchmark-for-LLMs
A reproducible test suite for evaluating melody-constrained lyric generation in ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Qwen, Claude, and more.
MelodyBench is the first open benchmark designed to evaluate how well Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate lyrics under strict melodic constraints.
This repository provides:
1. reproducible constraint-based tests,
2. standardized prompts,
3. automated scoring scripts, and
4. baseline outputs for GPT, Gemini, Grok, and others.
This benchmark accompanies the paper:
📄 “When Melodies Demand Structure: A Constraint-Based Benchmark for Lyric Generation in LLMs” (Shen, 2025)
